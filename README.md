# CrimsonCenterSite
Crimson Center hired me to make a site with PHP a while back. Adding that now

I think I made this in 2010. Lets just say i over engineered it a little and didnt really listen to the customer that well. Learned a lot but it quickly go replaced by someone who just made a wordpress site.
